h3. _YES_,

You can build a decent presentation outside of a cubersome, difficult to use, all bells and whistles, no fun, presentation software suite!

*Use your keyboard arrows to move through this presentation*
~~
h3. slim slides is a simple minimalistic presentation software that focus on content and not on superficial effects!
~~
h1. Plain text format loves you!

No more proprietary format to hold your data!
~~
h1. So it becomes easy to...

* compare presentations
* use "textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/ syntax to format your text
* paste code or integrate other plain format text
~~
h1. About Textile

Textile is a humane web text generator that lets you format your presentations in an easy way. _This presentation is formatted with textile_.

Here, have a look at "the complete syntax":http://textile.thresholdstate.com/
~~
h1. Code!

Copy and paste code directly into your presentation! Slim slides uses the javascript highliting library "shjs":http://shjs.sourceforge.net/. Just indicate the highlighter for your code and shjs takes care of it.
~~
<pre class="sh_python">
class You(object):
  def can_paste(self):
    code = Code()
    code.directly_into("slim slides")

  def feels_good(self):
    print "and awesome ;-)" 
</pre>

Yes! It looks great!
~~
h1. Give me an example!

Ok, just look at the _welcome_ file under the presentation folder. It's this presentation.
~~
h2. This is too simple, it does not do what I want.

Yep! I want to keep this simple, but I am planning to add:
* themes
* support outside of the appengine
* more awesomeness

^(end of presentation, we probably wrap around if you move to the next slide)^
